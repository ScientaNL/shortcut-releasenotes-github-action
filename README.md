# shortcut-releasenotes-github-action

Scienta's take on release notes using Shortcut:

- Decide which version is the predecessor of this release.
- Fetch stories from commit messages, pull requests and the comments on those PRs.
- Add a version label to all completed stories.
- Render all stories as release notes based on a given `ejs` template.

# Usage with Github Actions

Use this action on a release trigger. In the body of a release you can add a release notes tag. This tag will be substituted with the
generated release notes markdown.

## Example:
While creating a release in Github, add a tag to the release message body. Use the name of the predecessor of this release. All issues between the current release and it's given predecessor will added to the release notes.
```md
[rn > 7.2.0]
```

Will result in: 👇👇👇

# Release Notes 7.2.1
_Release notes are created between releases `7.2.0` and `7.2.1`._

# Development

## Run Docker Stack
Create a `.env` file based on the template. The payload of a github action can be retrieved by using [this action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/debug-action) in your workflow

Run using docker-compose:
```
docker-compose  up -d --force-recreate --remove-orphans
```

## install dependencies
```
docker exec -ti clubhouse-releasenotes-github-action yarn
```

## Run
Github Actions has the custom to use hyphens for inputs, even though inputs are transported to node using the environment.
At first I had the simulate-ga added as an yarn script, but both yarn and npm remove "invalid" values from the environment.

Use this bash script instead:
```
docker exec -ti clubhouse-releasenotes-github-action ./simulate-ga.sh
```
